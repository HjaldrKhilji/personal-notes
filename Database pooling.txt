database pooling is when you store database connection instead of making a new one each time for every query.
database pooling is useful because estabilisihing a database connection obviously requires computer recources like cpu time, memory
usage, etc.

in the sqlachemy library the default size of pools is 5, but this dosent mean that 5 connections will be open and stored as soon as your 
script runs, what it means instead, is that 5 connections will remain if 5 queries were made cocurrently. 

the pool_size argument of create_engine function in sqlachemy decides the size of the pool. the argument defaults to 5 when no value
is passed to the argument.  setting poolclass argument of the create_engine function to NULLPool will disable  pooling.max_overflow
is the amount of connections that can be made when the amount of connections excede the pool_size argument. the connections made 
after the pool_size is overflowed wont be alive once the query is finished.
if the amount of cocurrent quries are more than max_overflow + pool_size
then that query will be placed in a queue.
