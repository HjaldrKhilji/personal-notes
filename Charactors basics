so a charactor representation schemes:
represents charactors as code points.
eg: Unicode, ASCII
a charactor encoding schemes:
encodes every code point, and 
can be helpful in saving space 
if the right encoding is used, for your
usecase.
example: utf-8, utf-16, utf-32
charactor local:
formats single or multiple 
charactor code points based on 
cultural paremeters. for example:
it can change the way date is written.
example:
fr_FR 
fonts:
fonts tell us how the resulting text 
looks like. 
a good way to look at it is that 
first layer is:
charactor representation schemes.
then is:
charactor encoding.
then is:
charactor local.
then is:
fonts.
