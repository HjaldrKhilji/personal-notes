so a charactor sets:
represents ABSTRACT charactors as code points.
eg: Unicode, ASCII(tho ascii is a subset of unicode)
a charactor encoding schemes:
encodes every code point, and 
can be helpful in saving space 
if the right encoding is used, for your
usecase.
example: utf-8, utf-16, utf-32
ASCII is both a charactor set and charactor encoding, tho the charactor set is seen as a subset of unicode.
charactor local:
convets any input object like a 
date object into unicode charactors
based on cultural paremeters.
for example:
it can change the way date is written.
example:
fr_FR 
charactor locales can have
effects on file globbing, when it comes
to ranges: a-z can include
charactors like é if the local
says so. 
this is because a-z range expansion
is handled by charactor local.
furthur more the charactor encoding
might encode the resulting charactors
,so that z comes before a.
fonts:
fonts tell us how the resulting text 
looks like. 
a good way to look at it is that 
first layer is:
charactor sets.
then is:
charactor locale
it is worthy to note that charactor
locals simply inject unicode characters.
it isnt a sequential part of this pipeline.
then is:
charactor encoding.
then is:
fonts.
